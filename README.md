# Supporting Julia Scripts for ‚ÄúValidating thermodynamic models of arc-magma differentiation and training neural networks for rapid thermodynamic property inference‚Äù

This repository contains the **Julia scripts and configuration files** used in  
> Lorenzo G. Candioti, Chetan Nathwani, and Cyril Chelle-Michou (2025),  
> *Validating thermodynamic models of arc-magma differentiation and training neural networks for rapid thermodynamic property inference*

The scripts reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the article and are shared **for transparency and reproducibility**.  
They are *not* intended as a general-purpose software package or to be actively maintained.
